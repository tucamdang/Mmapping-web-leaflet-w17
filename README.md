# Earthquake Mapping - Visualising Data with Leaflet W17

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS provides scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. They develop new tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth. As new employee, I am part of this project and involve to visualise their earthquake data.
Having massive amount of data from all over the world, they find a way to display the map. 

Access this to visualise: https://tucamdang.github.io/Mapping-web-leaflet-w17/


By using this below two url links (data) to pull in the data for our visualisation.
1. basic:

2. Advanced:

### BASIC STEP
Generally, we have to import and visualise data:

Using Leaflet to creat a map which plots all earthquake based on Longitutude and Latitude from dataset. 
      -  Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in colour.
      -  popups that provide additional information 
      
### ADVANCED STEP:
      - Plot a second data set on our map
      - Add few overlays/ base map
